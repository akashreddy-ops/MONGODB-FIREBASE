What is MongoDB?

- MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require predefined schemas and is highly scalable, making it perfect for modern web applications.

What is Firebase?

- Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform developed by Google that offers tools such as real-time database, Firestore, authentication, hosting, cloud functions, and more.

Why Use MongoDB?

  - Schema-less structure (flexible)

  - High performance and scalability

  - Easy to integrate with JavaScript and Node.js

  - Great community and documentation

  - Powerful query language

Why Use Firebase?

  - Real-time database and Firestore

  - Built-in authentication (email/password, Google, GitHub, etc.)

  - Free hosting with SSL

  - Cloud functions and serverless

  - Google Analytics and Performance Monitoring
